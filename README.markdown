Lightning MAME Frontend
=======================

This program is a MAME frontend designed for Linux and especially Ubuntu. It was created to be easy to use, be very fast and focus on the essential features.

[You can download and install it right now.](https://github.com/nicolas-van/lightningmf/downloads)

Lightning MAME Frontend could work on any systems, but currently I only provide installer for Ubuntu. If you would like to create other installers yourself contact me on github.
